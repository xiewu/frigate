- For Frigate NVR, never write strings in the frontend directly. Since the project uses `react-i18next`, use `t()` and write the English string in the relevant translations file in `web/public/locales/en`.
- Always conform new and refactored code to the existing coding style in the project.
- Always have a way to test your work and confirm your changes. When running backend tests, use `python3 -u -m unittest`.
